#TMRCI CTC System
This is the root directory of the TMRCI CTC System files
The Arduino code takes keyboard inputs from a button matrix and sends them to the computer as keypresses
The JMRI System takes these keypad inputs and modifies the board to match them.
The CMRI boards take input from JMRI over a serial connection and turn operate the turnouts, signals, and locks. It also processes input from the block detectors.
